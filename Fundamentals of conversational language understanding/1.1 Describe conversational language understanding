🧠 What is CLU?
Conversational Language Understanding (CLU) enables you to build natural language 
interfaces for apps like chatbots and virtual assistants. It helps applications:
- Understand user intent
- Extract key information (entities) from what users say

🛠️ Core Concepts of CLU
1. Utterance
What the user says — an example input.
Example: “Turn on the light”

2. Intent
The goal or purpose of the utterance.
Example intent: TurnOn

3. Entity
Specific information or data in the utterance.
Example: “light” or “fan” → both are device entities

🧪 How CLU Works
- You define multiple intents (e.g., TurnOn, TurnOff, CheckWeather)
- For each intent, you provide sample utterances and label entities
- Train the model to recognize intents and extract entities
- The model generalizes and can understand variations in phrasing

🛡️ Fallback Handling with None Intent
The None intent is used when the user’s input doesn’t match any trained intent.
This helps provide a safe, generic response and avoid confusion.
Example: “What is the meaning of life?” → maps to None

🔁 Typical Use Case Flow
- User says something → Utterance
- Model predicts → Intent + Entities
- App responds → Based on matched intent

CLU is a key component in making AI-powered conversations natural and useful.
