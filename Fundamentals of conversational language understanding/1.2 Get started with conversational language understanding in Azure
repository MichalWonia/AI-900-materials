🚀 Overview
Azure CLU helps you build conversational apps that can:
- Understand user intent
- Extract meaningful data
- Power bots and virtual agents

🏗️ Key Components
1. Azure Resources
- Azure AI Language Resource: Used for both authoring and prediction
- Azure AI Services Resource: Used for prediction only

Use separate resources to better manage and track usage for training vs deployment.

✍️ Authoring a CLU Model
To create a model, define:

Element	    Purpose
Intent	    What the user wants (e.g., "TurnOn")
Entity	    Info in the utterance (e.g., "fan")
Utterance	  Sample phrase (e.g., "Turn on the fan")

- Use Language Studio (a web-based tool) to author models visually
- Optionally use prebuilt domains to save time

🧠 Training and Testing
- Train the model with your utterances
- Use test inputs to validate:
  - Is the intent correct?
  - Are the entities recognized?
- Update and retrain as needed

🔮 Prediction (Publishing)
Once the model works well:
- Publish it to a prediction resource
- Client apps send user inputs to the model’s endpoint
- The model returns:
  - Intent name
  - Entities (with values)
Your app can then use these to decide how to respond.

Azure CLU gives you powerful tools to build conversational agents without deep ML expertise.
