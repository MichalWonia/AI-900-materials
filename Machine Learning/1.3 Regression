📈 Regression (Supervised Learning)
Goal: Predict a numeric value (label y) from input features (x).

🛠️ Training Process Steps
- Split the data into training and validation sets.
- Train the model using a regression algorithm (e.g., Linear Regression).
- Validate the model by predicting labels for the validation set.
- Evaluate accuracy by comparing predicted values (ŷ) with actual values (y).

🧊 Example Scenario: Ice Cream Sales Prediction
- Feature (x): Temperature
- Label (y): Number of ice creams sold
- Model: f(x) = x - 50
Example: If temp = 77°F → predicted sales = 77 - 50 = 27 ice creams

📊 Evaluation Metrics
- Metric	Description	Example Value
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error)	Average of absolute errors	2.33
- MSE (Mean Squared Error)	Mean of squared errors (penalizes big errors)	6
- RMSE (Root MSE)	Square root of MSE (same units as label)	2.45
- R² (Coefficient of Determination)	Proportion of variance explained (0 to 1)	0.95

Higher R² = better model fit.
Lower MAE/RMSE = more accurate predictions.

🔁 Iterative Model Improvement
