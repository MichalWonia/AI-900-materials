1. Supervised Learning
- Definition: Training data includes features + known labels.
- Goal: Learn relationship between features and labels to predict future labels.

Regression
- Label is numeric (continuous value).
  Examples:
  - Predicting ice cream sales based on weather.
  - Predicting house prices from features.
  - Estimating fuel efficiency.

Classification
- Label is categorical.

Binary Classification:
- Two possible outcomes (e.g., Yes/No, 1/0).
  Examples:
  - Diabetes risk prediction.
  - Loan default detection.
  - Marketing response prediction.

Multiclass Classification:
- One label from multiple categories.
  Examples:
  - Penguin species classification.
  - Movie genre prediction.
- Also includes multilabel classification (e.g., a movie could be both comedy and sci-fi).

2. Unsupervised Learning
- No labels, only features.
- Goal: Find patterns or groupings in data.

ðŸ”˜ Clustering
- Groups similar data points into clusters.
  Examples:
  - Customer segmentation.
  - Grouping flowers by characteristics.

Key Difference from classification:
- In clustering, you donâ€™t know the categories beforehand.
- In classification, you do know the classes and train the model on them.
