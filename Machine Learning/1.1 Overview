Definition of Machine Learning:
- ML is about using historical data to predict future or unknown outcomes.
- The model learns a relationship between input features (x) and output labels (y).

ML as a Function:
- The trained model becomes a function:
y = f(x)
where x = features, y = label, and ŷ (y-hat) = predicted label.

Training vs. Inferencing:
- Training: Use labeled data to learn a function.
- Inferencing: Use the function to predict outputs for new, unseen inputs.

Features and Labels:
- Features (x): Input attributes (e.g., temperature, weight, flipper length).
- Label (y): What you're trying to predict (e.g., sales, disease risk, penguin species).

Example Scenarios:
- Retail: Predicting daily ice cream sales based on weather (features = weather data; label = sales count).
- Healthcare: Predicting diabetes risk from clinical measurements (features = health stats; label = risk outcome).
- Wildlife Research: Identifying penguin species from physical traits (features = flipper/bill size; label = species).

Mathematical Representation (AI-900 Simplified):
- Input vector: x = [x1, x2, x3, …]
- Output: ŷ = f(x)
- Goal: Learn a function f that maps x to y
