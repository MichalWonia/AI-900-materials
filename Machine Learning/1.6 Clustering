Clustering groups data based solely on feature similarity â€” no labels required.

K-Means is a widely used algorithm that:
- Initializes k random centroids.
- Assigns points to the nearest centroid.
- Recalculates centroids based on current cluster members.
- Repeats until stable.

Evaluation is not based on accuracy (no labels), but on cluster compactness and separation using metrics like:
- Silhouette Score (ranges from -1 to 1)
- Average/Max Distance to Centroid
- Inertia (within-cluster sum of squares)
