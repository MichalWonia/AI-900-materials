Multiclass classification predicts one of several possible classes (like penguin species).

Two common modeling approaches:
- One-vs-Rest (OvR): Trains a separate binary classifier per class.
- Multinomial (e.g., Softmax): Trains a single model that outputs a probability distribution across all classes.

The model predicts the class with the highest probability.

Evaluation is based on metrics like accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score, which can be calculated:
- Per class
- Overall (aggregated)

Using confusion matrices helps visualize where the model gets predictions right or wrong for each class â€” 
this is especially helpful in spotting which classes are most commonly misclassified.
