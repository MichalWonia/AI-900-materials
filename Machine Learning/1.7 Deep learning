What is Deep Learning?
- A specialized type of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks to mimic how the human brain processes information.
- "Deep" refers to multiple layers of neurons between the input and output.

⚙️ How It Works:
- Input Layer: Receives feature vector x (e.g., [bill length, bill depth, flipper length, weight]).
- Hidden Layers: Neurons apply weights (w) and activation functions to transform the data layer by layer.
- Output Layer: Outputs a probability vector using functions like softmax.

Example: [0.2, 0.7, 0.1] → class 1 (Gentoo) is most likely.

🔁 How It Learns:
- Forward pass: Compute predictions ŷ using current weights.
- Loss calculation: Compare ŷ to true y using a loss function.
- Backward pass (Backpropagation): Adjust weights using gradient descent to reduce error.
- Repeat over many epochs until model converges (low loss, high accuracy).

🧮 Why It’s Powerful:
- Can model complex, nonlinear relationships.
- Works well in image recognition, language translation, speech processing, etc.
- Scales with big data and benefits from GPU acceleration.
