AI agents are intelligent software systems that combine generative AI models, 
contextual data, and automation capabilities to perform tasks on behalf of users. 
They are designed not just to generate responses, but to act—making decisions, 
retrieving information, and even initiating or completing real-world actions.

🔍 Key Characteristics of AI Agents:
1. Context-aware
They use internal and external data (e.g., documents, user history, or environmental inputs) 
to understand the context in which they're operating.

2. Generative capabilities
They use models like GPT-4 to interpret user prompts 
and produce natural language responses or actions.

3. Task automation
Beyond answering questions, agents can take actions like submitting forms, 
triggering workflows, or coordinating with APIs.

🧾 Example: Expense Claim AI Agent
An AI agent designed to handle expense claims could:
- Use corporate policy documents to answer employee questions.
- Use rules and history to automatically submit recurring claims.
- Route submissions to the correct approvers.

✈️ Multi-Agent Example: Travel Booking + Expense Agent
In a more advanced setup:
- A travel booking agent books flights and hotels.
- It passes cost data to the expenses agent, which files a claim.
- The result: a coordinated system of AI agents completing multi-step business workflows.

🧠 In Summary:
AI agents are action-oriented, intelligent assistants that go beyond passive chat to drive business processes. 
They represent a key evolution from simple chatbots to autonomous, task-capable digital coworkers.
