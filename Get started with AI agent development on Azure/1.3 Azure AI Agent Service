ðŸ§© Core Components of an Azure AI Agent

Model -	The foundational LLM used to generate natural language responses. 
Options include OpenAI models (like GPT-4) and others available via Azure AI Foundry's model catalog.
Knowledge	- External data sources that ground the agent's responses.

ðŸ“š Knowledge Sources
These are the data sources the agent uses to ground its responses:
- Azure AI Search indexes â€“ Structured search data from your own content.
- Bing Search â€“ Live web search results from Microsoft Bing.
- Uploaded documents â€“ Files like PDFs or text that users upload to the conversation.
- Custom data integrations â€“ Your own databases, APIs, or storage systems connected to the agent.

ðŸ›  Tools
These are programmatic functions the agent can use to perform actions or generate dynamic content:
- Search tools â€“ Let the agent look up information using Bing or Azure AI Search.
- Code Interpreter â€“ Allows the agent to write and execute Python code.
- Custom tools â€“ Your own tools built with:
  - Azure Functions
  - REST APIs
  - Any logic you define

ðŸ’¬ Thread
A thread is the ongoing conversation between the user and the agent. It keeps track of:
- Dialogue history â€“ All previous messages exchanged.
- Uploaded files â€“ Documents and assets shared during the session.
- Tool outputs â€“ Results from any tools used (e.g., code results).
- Conversation state â€“ Any context or memory carried across the interaction.

ðŸ§ª Development Options
- Visual Agent Development: Use the Azure AI Foundry portal with
a playground interface to build, configure, and test agents using a GUI.

- Code-First Development: Use the Azure AI Foundry SDK for full control over agent logic,
orchestration, and integration into production systems.

âœ… Key Benefits
- Seamless integration with Azure AI ecosystem.
- Built-in safety and compliance features.
- Easily extensible through custom tools and plugins.
- Designed for both business users and professional developers.
