What is Document Intelligence?
Document intelligence uses machine learning (ML) to extract structured data from documents such as receipts, forms, and invoices. It focuses on:
- Text Extraction
- Layout Analysis
- Key-Value Pair Identification
- Bounding Box Localization (to determine where text appears on a page)

ðŸ§  How Does It Work?
- ML models recognize patterns in text and spatial layout.
- Example: A receipt might show Address: 123 Main Street, and the model identifies:
  - Key: Address
  - Value: 123 Main Street
  - Bounding box: Coordinates of the text on the document image

ðŸ§¾ Handling Different Document Types
- Documents vary in format, so different models may be required:
  - Use prebuilt models for common documents (e.g., IDs, receipts, invoices).
  - Train custom models for specific formats your business uses.

ðŸ’¼ Why Use It?
- Accelerates operations by automating data entry
- Improves accuracy and reduces manual errors
- Enhances customer experiences with faster processing
- Enables better decisions with structured, analyzable data
