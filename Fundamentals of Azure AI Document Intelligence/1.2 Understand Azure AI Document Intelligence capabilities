ðŸ’¡ What is Azure AI Document Intelligence?
Itâ€™s a cloud-based service that uses machine learning to extract structured data from unstructured documents. The capabilities are grouped into:
- Document Analysis â€“ General extraction of text, layout, and relationships.
- Prebuilt Models â€“ Pretrained for common document types (e.g., receipts, invoices, IDs).
- Custom Models â€“ Trained for your own document formats, including:
  - Custom neural model
  - Custom generative AI model
  - Classification models

ðŸ“¦ Prebuilt Model Examples
These models are trained to extract specific fields with high accuracy and include 
confidence scores for each extracted field. 
Document types supported include:
- Receipts â€“ Extracts merchant name, date, line items, totals, etc.
- Invoices â€“ Extracts vendor, customer, tax, amounts, etc.
- IDs â€“ Extracts name, DOB, ID number, and more.
- Contracts â€“ Pulls out parties, terms, and agreement details.
- Tax Forms & Mortgages â€“ Captures standardized financial data.

Each field's confidence score can guide automated workflows or human review.
