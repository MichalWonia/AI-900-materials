💡 What is Custom Question Answering?
Custom question answering is a feature in Azure AI Language 
that allows you to build a searchable knowledge base of question-and-answer (Q&A) pairs.
Users can ask natural language questions, and the service 
returns the best matching answer—even if the question is phrased differently.

🧰 How to Build a Custom Q&A Project
- Provision a Language resource in your Azure subscription.
- Use Azure AI Language Studio for a low-code approach (or use the REST API/SDK if coding is preferred).

🛠️ Creating Your Knowledge Base
You can:
- Import from an FAQ document or web page.
- Manually add questions and answers.
- Use both methods to enhance coverage.
- Add alternate phrasings to increase match accuracy (e.g., “Where is your head office?” vs. “What is your head office location?”).

🔍 Testing the Q&A System
- After building your Q&A pairs, save your project.
- Azure automatically applies NLP models to understand question variations.
- Use the test interface in Language Studio to simulate real queries and validate the system’s responses.

This setup is ideal for building chatbots, self-service portals, or any system that needs a smart, searchable Q&A interface.
