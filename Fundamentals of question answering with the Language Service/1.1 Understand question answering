ðŸ¤– What is Question Answering?
Question Answering is an Azure AI Language feature that enables natural, 
conversational interactions by allowing applications (like bots) to respond 
to user questions automatically using natural language understanding.

ðŸŸ¦ Key Use Cases:
- Customer support bots on websites or social media
- 24/7 self-service help desks
- Internal knowledge base assistants

ðŸ§© Key Capabilities:
- Responds to natural language questions
- Can handle multi-turn conversations (follow-up questions)
- Returns direct answers or suggests options
- Escalates to a human agent if the query is too complex

âœ… Benefits:
- Fast and accurate responses
- Reduces pressure on live support teams
- Scalable across multiple platforms
- Improves user satisfaction through availability and convenience

Next steps usually involve creating a question answering project using Azure resources, 
where you upload or connect a knowledge base (like FAQs or documentation) and let the AI 
model index it for answering questions.
