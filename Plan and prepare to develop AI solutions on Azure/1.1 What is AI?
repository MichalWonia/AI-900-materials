What is AI?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to a broad field of software 
capabilities that allow applications to simulate human-like behavior. 
This can include recognizing patterns, interpreting data, making decisions, 
and responding to inputs in ways that seem intelligent. Over the years, 
AI has evolved, and its definition has expanded as the technology advances.

In modern AI, machine learning models form the foundation, enabling applications 
to understand large datasets and generate responses or predictions. 
These models encapsulate patterns and relationships within data, allowing AI 
systems to interpret various types of inputs—such as text, images, or speech—and provide intelligent, context-aware outputs.

Common AI Capabilities
1. Generative AI

Description: The ability to generate original responses to prompts. 
For instance, software can automatically create product descriptions or marketing copy.

Example: A real estate business uses generative AI to write property 
descriptions based on input like location, size, and features.

2. Agents

Description: AI agents can respond autonomously to user 
input or assess situations and take appropriate actions.

Example: An executive assistant agent that can find the 
location of a meeting or book a taxi for you.

3. Computer Vision

Description: The ability to process visual inputs 
such as images, videos, and live streams.

Example: Automated checkout systems that use computer 
vision to recognize items in a cart without scanning barcodes.

4. Speech Recognition and Synthesis

Description: The ability to recognize and generate speech, 
enabling voice-driven applications.

Example: Digital assistants like Siri or 
Alexa that process spoken input and respond with verbal answers.

5. Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Description: AI's ability to understand and process natural language, 
whether written or spoken, to extract meaning or generate responses.

Example: Sentiment analysis of social media posts to
determine public opinion about a brand.

6. Information Extraction

Description: Extracting useful information from unstructured content, 
including documents, images, or speech.

Example: An expense management system that extracts details from 
receipts, such as purchase date and total cost.

7. Decision Support

Description: Using historical data and patterns to 
assist in making predictions or business decisions.

Example: Real estate market analysis that uses 
demographic data to predict property prices.

Generative AI
Generative AI is a cutting-edge area within AI that leverages 
language models to generate text, speech, or even images based on 
natural language prompts. These models can be large language models (LLMs),
which are trained on vast datasets and include millions or billions of parameters, 
or small language models (SLMs), optimized for specific tasks with fewer resources.

Generative AI is particularly useful for applications like:
- Conversational apps: Building chatbots or virtual assistants.
- Content creation: Automating writing, marketing copy, or even creating music.
- Task automation: Automating repetitive tasks by responding to user queries.

Generative models increasingly work with multi-modal inputs and outputs, 
meaning they can handle not only text but also images, speech, or code.

In summary: AI includes a wide variety of capabilities, from generative tasks like content 
creation to specialized functions like speech recognition and decision support. 
By selecting the right AI capabilities for your application, you can tailor solutions 
that make your software smarter and more efficient.
