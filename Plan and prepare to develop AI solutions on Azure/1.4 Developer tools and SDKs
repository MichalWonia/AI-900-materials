Developer Tools and SDKs for AI Development on Azure

When developing AI solutions using Azure AI Foundry,
developers have access to a wide range of tools and environments 
to help with writing, testing, and deploying code. 
The choice of tools and SDKs depends on the developer's preferred languages, 
frameworks, and development environments.

Development Tools and Environments
1. Visual Studio vs. Visual Studio Code:
Developers can choose between different development 
environments based on their preferences and the nature of their projects:

Visual Studio: Ideal for developers working with the .NET Framework and 
Windows applications. It's a feature-rich IDE with deep integration for Microsoft technologies.

Visual Studio Code (VS Code): A lightweight, open-source code editor,
perfect for developers working across a range of programming languages 
and frameworks. VS Code supports various extensions and 
integrates well with Azure AI Foundry.

VS Code in Azure AI Foundry:
Within the Azure AI Foundry portal, developers can use VS Code 
containers to access pre-configured development environments that include 
all the SDKs and packages required for building AI applications on Azure. 
This setup is beneficial because it eliminates the need for developers 
to manually configure environments.

Tip: When using the VS Code container image in Azure AI Foundry, remember to account 
for the cost of compute resources and the available quota to support developers.

2. GitHub and GitHub Copilot:
GitHub is widely used for version control and collaborative development. 
Both Visual Studio and VS Code integrate natively with GitHub, making it 
easy to manage repositories, track changes, and collaborate on code.

GitHub Copilot: An AI-powered code assistant integrated into GitHub 
and supported in both Visual Studio and VS Code. Copilot can suggest 
code snippets, help with documentation, and provide context-aware 
suggestions to improve productivity.

Programming Languages, APIs, and SDKs
Azure AI Foundry supports a wide array of programming languages and frameworks, 
allowing developers to use their preferred tools while leveraging Azure AI services.

1. Programming Languages:
C#, Python, Node.js, TypeScript, and Java are common programming languages 
supported for AI development in Azure. Python, in particular, 
is widely used for AI and machine learning tasks.

2. Azure AI Foundry SDK:
The Azure AI Foundry SDK is essential for developers working with Azure AI Foundry. 
It allows developers to connect to their Azure AI Foundry projects, access resource connections, 
and interact with the resources within those projects.

3. Azure AI Services SDKs:
To consume Azure AI services (e.g., Azure OpenAI, Azure AI Vision), 
developers will use service-specific SDKs for different programming
languages and frameworks. These SDKs simplify interacting with
Azure AI services by abstracting the complexities of REST APIs.

4. Azure AI Agent Service:
The Azure AI Agent Service allows developers to create intelligent 
agents and integrate them into frameworks such as AutoGen and Semantic Kernel. 
This service is accessible through the Azure AI Foundry SDK and is used 
to build advanced AI agent solutions.

5. Prompt Flow SDK:
Prompt Flow is a tool for orchestrating the logic behind interactions with generative AI models. 
The Prompt Flow SDK enables developers to define the flow of prompts and responses, 
making it easier to build applications that rely on generative AI capabilities.

Integration and Workflow:
By using the Azure AI Foundry SDKs, developers can seamlessly integrate different 
Azure AI services, build AI models, and manage resources within their Azure environment. 
Developers can use these tools and SDKs to:
- Connect to Azure AI Foundry projects.
- Develop AI applications by utilizing AI models and services.
- Orchestrate prompt flows and interactions with generative AI models.
- Manage resources and access control at the hub and project levels.

Conclusion
Azure provides a broad ecosystem of tools, SDKs, and environments for building AI solutions. 
Whether you're using Visual Studio, VS Code, or working with GitHub Copilot to assist with coding,
Azure AI Foundry ensures that you have the necessary resources to develop, test, and deploy
your AI applications efficiently. By leveraging the Azure AI Foundry SDK, AI Services SDKs, 
and other tools like Prompt Flow, you can streamline the development of sophisticated
AI-powered solutions on Azure.
