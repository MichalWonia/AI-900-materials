1. Map Potential Harms
Goal: Identify the types of harms your generative AI solution could cause.

Key Considerations:
- Content harms: Could the model generate misinformation, offensive content, or unsafe outputs?
- Fairness and bias: Could the model output reflect or amplify harmful stereotypes?
- Privacy risks: Could generated content include or infer private or sensitive information?
- Misuse: Could your system be exploited for harmful or unintended purposes?

Action Steps:
- Conduct a harm assessment workshop with stakeholders (technical, legal, ethical, domain experts).
- Create a risk register that documents possible harms specific to your use case.

2. Measure the Presence of Harms
Goal: Evaluate whether and how often your solution produces harmful outputs.

Key Considerations:
- Develop a harm taxonomy relevant to your domain (e.g., toxicity, misinformation, bias).
- Use automated tools and human review to test outputs against the harm criteria.
- Perform scenario-based evaluations using representative prompts.

Action Steps:
- Build test sets with prompts that probe known areas of risk.
- Use metrics or scoring frameworks to measure harm frequency and severity (e.g., toxicity scores, fairness audits).

3. Mitigate Harms
Goal: Reduce the likelihood and impact of harms in your generative AI system.

Key Mitigation Layers:
- Model layer: Choose models with built-in safety controls (e.g., fine-tuned models, content filters).
- System layer: Apply guardrails such as output filtering, prompt validation, and user access control.
- UX layer: Provide clear disclosures, usage instructions, and opt-out mechanisms.
- User feedback: Allow users to report problematic content or behavior.

Action Steps:
- Implement real-time content moderation.
- Fine-tune or prompt-engineer models to reduce sensitivity to high-risk inputs.
- Use reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) where feasible.

4. Manage the Solution Responsibly
Goal: Ensure the solution is ready for deployment and managed sustainably post-launch.

Key Considerations:
- Have a clear governance plan for who owns risk decisions.
- Define roles and responsibilities for monitoring, incident response, and model updates.
- Create a user communication plan to explain limitations and obtain informed consent.

Action Steps:
- Set up an ongoing risk monitoring system and response workflow.
- Publish transparency documentation (e.g., model cards, data usage, limitations).
- Review and update the system based on user feedback and emerging risks.

Summary of the 4 Mâ€™s Framework:
- Stage	Purpose	Key Focus Areas
- Map	Identify risks	Bias, safety, misuse, privacy
- Measure	Evaluate system performance	Testing outputs, harm frequency
- Mitigate	Reduce risks across all system layers	Model tuning, filters, user education
- Manage	Deploy and operate responsibly	Governance, monitoring, transparency
