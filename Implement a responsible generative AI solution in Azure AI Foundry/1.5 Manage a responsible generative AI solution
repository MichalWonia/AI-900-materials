‚úÖ 1. Complete Prerelease Reviews
Before releasing, consult all necessary stakeholders for formal reviews:

Review          Type	Purpose
Legal	          Ensure the solution complies with laws (e.g., IP, liability, contracts).
Privacy	        Confirm data handling aligns with privacy laws (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
Security	      Assess for vulnerabilities or threats (e.g., prompt injections, misuse).
Accessibility	  Validate that your solution is usable by all, including people with disabilities.

Use these reviews to align with your organization‚Äôs Responsible AI policy or any external regulatory frameworks.

üöÄ 2. Plan for Safe Release and Operations
Release your solution gradually and cautiously, using these operational safeguards:

Action	                          Why It Matters
Phased rollout	                  Start with a limited audience to catch unexpected issues early.
Incident response plan	          Prepare for fast, structured action if harm or failure occurs.
Rollback plan	                    Have a clear way to revert to a safer version of your solution.
Block harmful responses/users	    Prevent further harm quickly if issues arise.
Feedback loop	                    Let users report issues (e.g., inaccurate, offensive, or biased output).
Telemetry tracking	              Collect data (in compliance with privacy standards) to monitor usage, satisfaction, and identify risks or UI problems.

üõ°Ô∏è 3. Use Azure AI Content Safety
Microsoft‚Äôs Azure AI Content Safety tools are crucial for automated risk detection and response:

Feature	                          Description
Prompt Shields	                  Detect prompt injection and harmful user inputs.
Groundedness Detection	          Identify if the response is based on verified sources (helps reduce hallucination).
Protected Material Detection	    Scan for copyrighted content.
Custom Categories	                Define organization-specific flags (e.g., fraud-related terms).

These tools work in tandem with filters in Azure OpenAI, Vision, and 
Language services to identify and suppress potentially harmful input/output.

üìå Final Tips
- Documentation matters: Clearly state system limitations, mitigations, and any residual risks.
- Transparency builds trust: Be open with users about how the system works and how it's moderated.
- Iterate continuously: Post-launch, revisit your harm map and metrics regularly. Update your models and safety layers as risks evolve.
