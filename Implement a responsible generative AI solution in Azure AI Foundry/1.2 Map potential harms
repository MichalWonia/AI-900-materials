1. Identify Potential Harms
Understand the specific risks posed by your generative AI system based on:
- The models and services you're using (e.g., GPT-4 via Azure OpenAI).
- Any fine-tuning, grounding data, or system-specific configurations.
- Use-cases and intended functionality.

Common examples of harms:
- Offensive or discriminatory content
- Misinformation or factual inaccuracies
- Encouraging illegal, harmful, or unethical behavior

Recommended actions:
- Review official documentation (e.g., GPT-4 system cards, transparency notes).
- Use tools like the Microsoft Responsible AI Impact Assessment Guide to evaluate and log potential harms.

2. Prioritize Identified Harms
Rank harms based on:
- Likelihood of occurrence
- Impact severity

Example decision factors:
- Potential misuse vs. intended use
- Sensitivity of the application context (e.g., food safety vs. security threats)

Tip: Engage stakeholders including legal, ethical, and domain experts to guide prioritization.

3. Test and Verify Harms
Once prioritized, simulate real-world use and test for actual harm emergence.

Best practice: Use red team testing:
- Simulate malicious or adversarial user behavior
- Attempt to trigger unsafe, biased, or otherwise harmful outputs
- Explore edge cases (e.g., asking for toxic advice, biased prompts, manipulation)

Goal: Determine conditions under which harms manifest and validate your harm assumptions.

4. Document and Share Harms
Keep a living record of:
- Verified harms (including descriptions, triggers, and severity)
- Red team results
- Risk decisions and rationale

Share findings with:
- Internal stakeholders (product teams, policy leads)
- Governance/compliance bodies
- Documentation consumers (e.g., via model/system cards)

✅ Final Takeaway
Mapping harms isn’t a one-off task—it’s a continuous process embedded in the lifecycle of AI development. 
Identifying, prioritizing, validating, and documenting potential harms early ensures your 
generative AI system is built with safety, fairness, and accountability in mind.
