üìñ OCR: Where Vision Meets Language
OCR (Optical Character Recognition) is a foundational AI technology that:
- Uses computer vision to detect characters and words in images.
- Applies natural language processing (NLP) to interpret and make sense of the extracted text.

Originally developed for tasks like postal code recognition, OCR now supports:
- Printed and handwritten text
- Complex layouts and visually noisy images
- Multiple languages and fonts

üîç Azure AI Vision Read API (OCR Engine)
Azure AI Vision's Read API is the core OCR engine that:
- Extracts machine-readable text from:
  - Images
  - PDFs
  - TIFF files
- Is optimized for real-world images, not just scanned documents
- Automatically selects the best recognition model based on the content

Key Features:
- Detects bounding boxes around:
  - Pages
  - Lines
  - Words

- Handles visual noise, mixed content, and text-heavy images

- Supports printed and handwritten text detection

üìê OCR Output Structure
The output from the Read API is structured hierarchically:

Level	  Description
Page	  Contains metadata like dimensions and orientation
Line	  A sequence of words (e.g., a sentence or title)
Word	  Individual word with associated bounding box and text

Each element includes bounding box coordinates, so you know exactly where each word or line appears on the image.

This setup enables scenarios like:
- Digitizing handwritten notes or letters
- Extracting addresses from envelopes
- Processing receipts, forms, or signs in photos
