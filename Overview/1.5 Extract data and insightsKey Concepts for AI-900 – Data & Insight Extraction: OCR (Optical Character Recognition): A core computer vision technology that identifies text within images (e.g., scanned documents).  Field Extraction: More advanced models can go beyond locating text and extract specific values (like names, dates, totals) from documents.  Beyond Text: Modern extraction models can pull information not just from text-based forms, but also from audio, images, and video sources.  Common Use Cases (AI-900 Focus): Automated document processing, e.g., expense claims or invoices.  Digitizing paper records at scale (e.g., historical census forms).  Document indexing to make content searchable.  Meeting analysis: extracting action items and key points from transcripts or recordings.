OCR (Optical Character Recognition):
A core computer vision technology that identifies text within images (e.g., scanned documents).

Field Extraction:
More advanced models can go beyond locating text and extract specific values (like names, dates, totals) from documents.

Beyond Text:
Modern extraction models can pull information not just from text-based forms, but also from audio, images, and video sources.

Common Use Cases:
- Automated document processing, e.g., expense claims or invoices.
- Digitizing paper records at scale (e.g., historical census forms).
- Document indexing to make content searchable.
- Meeting analysis: extracting action items and key points from transcripts or recordings.
