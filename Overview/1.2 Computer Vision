Definition:
Computer vision involves training models using large sets of images to enable them to understand and interpret visual data.

Image Classification:
A model is trained on labeled images to identify the main subject in new, unlabeled images.

Object Detection:
The model can locate specific objects within an image, not just classify the image.

Semantic Segmentation:
A more advanced technique where the model labels each pixel in an image that belongs to a specific object (more precise than bounding boxes).

Multi-Modal AI:
You can combine computer vision with language models to create multi-modal AI, blending vision and generative AI capabilities.

Common Use Cases for Computer Vision:
- Auto-captioning and tag generation for images.
- Visual search (e.g., finding similar items based on a picture).
- Retail inventory monitoring and self-checkout systems.
- Security video monitoring.
- Facial recognition for authentication.
- Robotics and autonomous vehicles navigation.
