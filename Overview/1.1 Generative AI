Definition of Generative AI:
Generative AI is a branch of AI that can generate new content, such as text, images, video, code, etc.

Language Models:
Generative AI relies on language models trained on large datasets (often from public sources) to understand and generate human-like content.

Semantic Understanding:
These models understand the relationships between words, enabling them to produce meaningful and coherent responses.

Large vs. Small Language Models:
- LLMs: Trained on massive datasets; powerful and general-purpose, but costly.
- SLMs: Trained on smaller datasets; cost-efficient and good for specific tasks.

Use Cases of Generative AI:
- Chatbots and AI assistants.
- Content creation (e.g., drafting documents).
- Language translation.
- Summarization and explanation of complex texts.
