Definition:
NLP (Natural Language Processing) is the ability of AI to analyze and derive meaning from human language (spoken or written).

Model Types:
NLP uses models trained for specific text analysis tasks. While generative AI handles many NLP tasks today, simpler NLP models can be more cost-effective for targeted use cases.

Common NLP Tasks:
- Entity Extraction: Identify mentions of people, places, organizations, etc.
- Text Classification: Categorize documents into predefined groups.
- Sentiment Analysis: Determine if the tone is positive, negative, or neutral.
- Language Detection: Identify the language used in a document or sentence.

NLP vs. NLU:
NLP is often referred to interchangeably with NLU (Natural Language Understanding), especially when emphasizing comprehension.

Common NLP Use Cases (AI-900 Focus):
- Analyzing documents, transcripts, or calls to extract key entities and topics.
- Understanding sentiment in social media posts, reviews, or news articles.
- Powering chatbots that handle predictable, FAQ-style conversations (without needing generative AI).
