What Are Azure AI Services?
Azure AI services are ready-made, cloud-based AI tools that developers can plug into apps using APIs ‚Äî no need to build models from scratch.

üß∞ Examples of Azure AI Services
- Azure OpenAI Service: Access to GPT models (e.g., GPT-4) for generative AI.
- Azure AI Content Safety: Detects harmful or offensive content in text/images.
- Azure AI Language: Summarizes text, classifies documents, extracts key phrases.
- Azure AI Speech: Converts speech ‚Üî text, generates natural voice audio.
- Azure AI Vision: Image and video analysis; supports customization for specific use cases.
- Immersive Reader: Supports accessibility and learning by adapting content presentation.

üöÄ Why Use Azure AI Services?
1. Prebuilt & Ready to Use
- No data science team needed ‚Äî just connect and go.

2. Accessed via APIs
- Simple to integrate into apps (via REST, SDKs, or automation tools).

3. Available & Secure on Azure
- Managed like any other Azure service (reliable, scalable, secure).

üß† Customization Options
Some services allow fine-tuning or customization:
- Vision (e.g., for sports analytics)
- Speech (e.g., for custom vocabularies)
- OpenAI (e.g., prompt engineering, embeddings)

üõ°Ô∏è Security & Responsible AI
- Microsoft follows six Responsible AI principles to ensure safe and ethical use.
- Certain services may be restricted to prevent misuse (e.g., facial recognition).

Azure AI lets you bring the power of machine learning into your app without needing to build the model yourself.
