Two Types of Azure AI Resources
Multi-Service Resource
  - Grants access to multiple AI services (like Language, Vision, Speech, etc.) with one key and endpoint.
  - Ideal for: Exploring AI broadly or building apps that use several AI tools.
  - Billing: All services are grouped into one billing resource.

Single-Service Resource
  - Access to just one Azure AI service (e.g., Speech, Language, Face, etc.).
  - Ideal for: Using only one AI capability or tracking costs separately.
  - Billing: Each resource has its own key, endpoint, and cost tracking.

🧭 How to Create a Resource in the Azure Portal
- Log in to the Azure Portal: https://portal.azure.com
- Click: "Create a resource"
- Search:
  - For multi-service → search “Azure AI services”
  - For single-service → search specific name (e.g., “Language”, “Speech”, “Content Safety”)
- Configure:
  - Select subscription
  - Choose or create a resource group
  - Pick the region
  - Enter a unique name
  - Select a pricing tier (most offer a free tier)

By creating these resources, you’re provisioning access to powerful AI tools — making them callable via API using generated keys and endpoints.
