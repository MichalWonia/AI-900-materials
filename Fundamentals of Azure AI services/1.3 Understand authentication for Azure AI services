🔐 Authentication in Azure AI Services
Authentication ensures that only authorized users and apps can access your AI resources. Here's how it works:

📡 Key Authentication Components
1. 🔗 Endpoint
A unique URL for your specific AI service instance.

Example: https://myaiservices29.cognitiveservices.azure.com/

2.🔑 Resource Key
A secure key (like a password) used to verify the application making the request.
Each AI resource has two keys (primary and secondary) so one can be rotated without downtime.

3. 🔐 Authentication Header

When calling the API, you must include:
- The endpoint
- An authorization header with your resource key

Example in an HTTP request: Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: <your-key>

🧠 Behind the Scenes: Studio Interfaces
When using Azure tools like Language Studio or Speech Studio, Azure handles authentication in the background after you sign in.

✅ Key Benefits
- Keeps services secure and private
- Allows for key rotation to maintain security
- Supports programmatic access through APIs
