🗣️ Speech Recognition (Speech-to-Text)
Goal: Convert spoken language (live or recorded) into written text.

🔍 How it works:
- Acoustic model: Maps audio to phonemes (basic sounds)
- Language model: Converts phonemes to the most likely words/phrases
- Output: Readable text transcript

📌 Common Uses:
- Live closed captioning for video
- Meeting or phone call transcripts
- Voice command processing (e.g., in apps or virtual assistants)

🔊 Speech Synthesis (Text-to-Speech)
Goal: Convert text into natural-sounding speech audio

🔧 How it works:
- Tokenizes text into words
- Assigns phonemes to words
- Organizes into speech units (phrases, sentences)
- Applies a voice with chosen pitch, rate, and tone
- Generates audio output

📌 Common Uses:
- Spoken responses in apps and bots
- Voice menus for customer service
- Accessibility tools (e.g., reading emails aloud)
- Public announcements (e.g., train stations)

Both technologies are part of Azure AI Speech Services and can be used 
together for voice-driven applications like chatbots, virtual agents, 
and hands-free interfaces.
