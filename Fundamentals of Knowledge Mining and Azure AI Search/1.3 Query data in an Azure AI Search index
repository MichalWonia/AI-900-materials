âœ… Query Types
- Simple syntax (default): Great for most use cases.
- Full Lucene syntax: Used for advanced filters and scoring.

ðŸ§± Index Schema Matters
- You can only search/filter/sort on fields explicitly marked as such in the index schema.
- If a field isnâ€™t marked as searchable, it won't be searched even if included in the query.

ðŸ’¬ Sample Simple Query
coffee (-"busy" + "wifi")
- Looks for documents with "coffee"
- Excludes those containing "busy"
- Includes those containing "wifi"

ðŸ’¡ Example API Query (REST)

GET https://[your-search-service].search.windows.net/indexes/[index-name]/docs?api-version=2023-07-01&search=coffee
api-key: [your-query-key]

You can expand this query with parameters like:
- $filter (e.g., $filter=price lt 10)
- $orderby (e.g., $orderby=rating desc)
- $select (to choose which fields to return)
