🔍 Core Concepts of Text Analytics & NLP
🧠 1. Tokenization
- Breaking text into tokens (words, parts of words, or punctuation).
- Example: “we choose to go to the moon” → {we, choose, to, go, to, the, moon}.

🧼 2. Text Normalization & Preprocessing
- Normalization: lowercase, remove punctuation.
- Stop word removal: filters out common but semantically weak words like “the”, “a”.
- n-grams: group of words – unigram (1), bigram (2), trigram (3), etc.
- Stemming: reducing words to their root (e.g., “powered” → “power”).

📊 3. Frequency Analysis
- Count token frequency to infer topics.
- TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency): finds important words in a document relative to a corpus.

🤖 4. Text Classification with Machine Learning
- Use labeled data (e.g., sentiment: positive=1, negative=0) to train models like logistic regression.
- The model learns token-sentiment relationships.

🧭 5. Semantic Language Models
- Words are represented as vectors (embeddings) in high-dimensional space.
- Semantically similar words (e.g., “dog” and “bark”) are closer together.
- These embeddings support modern NLP tasks.
