🖼️ What Is an Image to a Computer?
An image is essentially data — more specifically, a 2D or 3D array of pixel values.

Grayscale images:
Just one 2D array of numbers from 0 (black) to 255 (white).

Color images:
Represented using three channels (Red, Green, Blue), each a separate 2D array.

Example:
A purple pixel might be: Red: 150, Green: 0, Blue: 255
A yellow pixel might be: Red: 255, Green: 255, Blue: 0

🧪 What Are Filters?
Filters (or kernels) are small matrices used to transform an image by sliding (convolving) over it.

Example kernel (for edge detection):

-1 -1 -1
-1  8 -1
-1 -1 -1

This kernel highlights the edges in an image by computing the difference in brightness between a pixel and its neighbors.

🔁 How Filtering Works: Convolution
- Overlay the kernel on a part of the image.
- Multiply each kernel value by the corresponding pixel.
- Add the results to get the new pixel value.
- Move the kernel across the image and repeat.

➡️ This is called convolution.

✨ Types of Filters and Effects
- Edge Detection: Laplace, Sobel
- Blur: Gaussian blur
- Sharpening
- Embossing
- Color manipulation: Inversion, grayscale conversion, etc.
