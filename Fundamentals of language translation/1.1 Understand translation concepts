1. Literal vs. Semantic Translation:
- Literal Translation:
  - Direct word-for-word translation.
  - Issues arise when there's no equivalent word in the target language or when the context is lost.
  - Example: "I am hungry" (literal translation) may not convey the emotional tone if translated word-for-word in some languages.

Semantic Translation:
  - Focuses on the meaning and context rather than just words.
  - Ensures that idioms, grammar rules, formal vs informal tone, and colloquialisms are accurately interpreted.
  - Example: Translating a phrase that carries cultural or emotional meaning (e.g., a joke or metaphor) so that it makes sense in the target language.

2. Text and Speech Translation:
- Text Translation:
  - Used for translating written content such as documents, web pages, emails, and social media posts.
  - Example: Google Translate can translate entire web pages in real time or when you post something on social media.

- Speech Translation:
  - Involves spoken language translation, where speech can be translated into another language,
  either directly or through an intermediary (e.g., speech-to-text to text translation, 
  and then text-to-speech for another language).
  - Example: A real-time translation app allowing someone speaking English to converse with 
  someone speaking French by translating their speech instantly.

By understanding these concepts, machine translation (like Azure AI Translator) can offer more accurate translations, 
overcoming challenges like literal translation limitations.
