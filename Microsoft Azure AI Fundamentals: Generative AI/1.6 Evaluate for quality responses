üåê Improving Performance and Trustworthiness
1. Grounding Data
- Definition: Ensuring AI responses are aligned with reliable and 
contextual data sources, like databases, domain knowledge, or real-time information.
- Purpose: This ensures that responses are factual and contextually relevant.
- Example: Linking the model to real-time databases to pull updated data.

2. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Definition: Enhancing a language model by connecting it to proprietary databases, 
allowing the model to retrieve domain-specific and up-to-date information for more accurate responses.
- Purpose: Useful for applications like customer support or knowledge 
management, where access to dynamic data is critical.

3. Fine-Tuning
- Definition: Refining a pre-trained model with a smaller, 
task-specific dataset to tailor it for particular tasks or domains.
- Purpose: Improves the model's accuracy and specialization, 
making it better suited to specific industries or applications (e.g., healthcare, finance).

4. Security and Governance Controls
- Definition: Setting up rules and frameworks to ensure safe usage of AI systems, 
focusing on access control, authentication, and data management.
- Purpose: Prevents the model from generating inaccurate or unauthorized 
content and ensures secure handling of data.

üìä Metrics to Measure Response Quality
To evaluate the quality of AI responses, consider these key dimensions:

1. Performance and Quality Evaluators
- Measures the accuracy, groundedness, and relevance of the generated content.

2. Risk and Safety Evaluators
- Focuses on the safety of the output, ensuring that the system does not generate harmful, biased, or inappropriate content.

3. Custom Evaluators
- Industry-specific metrics are used to meet the unique needs of different sectors (e.g., finance, healthcare, etc.).

üå± Planning for Responsible AI Use
The key takeaway from this section is the importance of combining quality control,
real-time data, and safe usage protocols to improve the performance and reliability 
of AI systems while minimizing risks. Services like Azure AI Foundry provide frameworks 
to help facilitate these workflows.
