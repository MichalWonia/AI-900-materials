🧠 What is Generative AI?
Generative AI is a category of artificial intelligence focused on creating
new content rather than just analyzing existing data.
It uses language models or multimodal models to generate:
- 📝 Text (e.g., essays, emails, code)
- 🎨 Images (e.g., logos, illustrations)
- 🧑‍💻 Code (e.g., scripts, programs)
- 🗣️ Speech or audio (via voice cloning or synthesis)
- 📊 Data or summaries (like reports from raw inputs)

🔍 Examples of Generative AI in Action
- Text: "Write a resume for a project manager" → returns a formatted resume.
- Image: "Design a logo for a tech startup" → returns an AI-generated logo.
- Code: "Generate JavaScript to create a countdown timer" → outputs working code.

⚙️ Types of Generative AI Applications
Type                        Description	                                            Example
Ready-to-use	              No code needed; plug-and-play tools.	                  Bing Chat, ChatGPT
Extendable	                Customize with your own data.	                          Microsoft Copilot with your documents
Build from foundation	      Fully custom assistants built from a base model.	      Using Azure OpenAI to build your own agent

🤖 What Are AI Agents?
Agents are advanced generative AI applications that don’t just generate responses—they can take actions. For example:
- Booking a ride
- Scheduling a meeting
- Sending emails based on context

🧰 Tools from Microsoft
- Microsoft Copilot Studio: Extend Copilot with your data or workflows.
- Azure AI Foundry: Develop generative AI solutions from models (like OpenAI, Meta, etc.).
