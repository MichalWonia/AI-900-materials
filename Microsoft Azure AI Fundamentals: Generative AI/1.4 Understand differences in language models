🏗️ Foundation Models: Pretrained Building Blocks
- Definition: Pretrained models trained on massive, diverse datasets.
- Use: Can be used out-of-the-box or fine-tuned for a specific task/domain.
- Sources:
  - Open-source (e.g., Hugging Face, EleutherAI)
  - Proprietary (e.g., OpenAI models via Azure, OpenAI API)

🛠️ Common Tasks for Language Models
- Text classification (e.g., spam detection)
- Token classification (e.g., named entity recognition)
- Question answering
- Summarization
- Translation

You can choose a model depending on your task, the model's training data, 
and your tolerance for risks (e.g., bias, hallucination).

📏 LLMs vs. SLMs: Choose by Use Case
Feature	              Large Language Models (LLMs)	                    Small Language Models (SLMs)
Data scale	          Trained on massive, general-purpose datasets	    Trained on smaller, often specialized datasets
Model size	          Billions to trillions of parameters	              Fewer parameters
Strengths	            Broad language understanding and generation	      Fast, efficient, focused performance
Deployment	          Best for cloud-based apps	                        Suitable for on-device or edge computing
Fine-tuning	          Expensive and time-consuming	                    More accessible for smaller teams and budgets

🎯 Choosing the Right Model
- Use LLMs when you need broad capabilities (like multi-turn conversations or creative writing).
- Use SLMs for fast, domain-specific tasks or if you're targeting edge devices with limited compute.
