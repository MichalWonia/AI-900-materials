üìã Improving Prompt Results: Best Practices
1 .Start with a Specific Goal
Be clear about what you want the AI to do. For example, instead of just saying, 
"Summarize the document," specify the tone, length, and format, e.g., 
"Summarize the key considerations for adopting Copilot in no more
than six bullet points with a professional tone."

2. Provide a Source
Including a source ensures that the AI‚Äôs response is 
grounded in specific, relevant information. 
This could be a document, a database, or even prior responses.

3. Add Context
The more context you give, the more tailored and 
relevant the output will be. For example, 
if you're asking for business advice, provide details about 
the company, the industry, or the decision-makers involved.

4. Set Clear Expectations
Let the AI know the format you want. 
This might include length (e.g., a 200-word summary), 
style (e.g., formal, concise), or any other specific 
instructions for how the information should be presented.

5. Iterate Based on Responses
After getting an initial response, refine your prompts 
and give feedback to narrow the AI's focus. 
This iterative process improves the outcome by fine-tuning what you're asking.

‚öôÔ∏è How AI Prompts Are Enhanced
In most cases, the system does more than just send your prompt as-is to the language model:
- System Messages: These guide how the model should behave, e.g., "Respond in a friendly, professional manner."
- Conversation History: Helps maintain context, ensuring responses are relevant and coherent across the conversation.
- Optimized Prompting: The agent can enhance your prompt by refining wording or adding extra context to improve accuracy.

üßë‚Äçüíª What is Prompt Engineering?
- Definition: The process of refining and improving the 
prompts given to AI, either by developers or users, to get the most effective responses.
- Why It Matters: With clear, well-structured prompts, 
you can unlock more meaningful, precise, and relevant AI-generated content.
